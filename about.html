                    <p>
                      <strong>Raised in Australia, now studying in London</strong>, my journey has been anything but ordinary. 
                      After a decade-long career in hospitality, I decided to follow my passion for 1's & 0's and made the leap into 
                      Computer Science with a formal education from <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/">Goldsmiths, University of London</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This past summer, I worked as a <strong>Software Engineer Intern at <a href="https://www.factset.com/">FactSet</a></strong> and am thrilled to be returning 
                      as a <strong>Graduate Software Engineer in 2025</strong>. Until then, I’m keeping busy as a 
                      <strong>FactSet Student Ambassador</strong>, helping to connect students at my university with the exciting 
                      opportunities in finance and tech.

                      My love for games is what first sparked my interest in programming, way back in the days of tinkering with RTS 
                      game editors. It’s safe to say that curiosity has grown into a full-blown passion.

                      I’m currently diving into <strong>generalisation in Reinforcement Learning agents</strong>, exploring how 
                      procedurally generated training environments can improve adaptability. Alongside this, I’m:
